  <!--Description-->
  <p>React Bootstrap carousel is responsive and interactive slideshow which is created for presenting content,
    especially images and videos.</p>

  <p>The carousel is a slideshow for cycling through a series of content. It works with a series of images, text, or
    custom markup. It also includes support for previous/next controls and indicators.</p>

  <p>Please be aware that nested carousels are not supported, and carousels are generally not compliant with
    accessibility standards.</p>
